# MLYandexAcademy
Solving the detection problem COVID-19

## Overview
This competition is the final project within the machine learning intensive course of the Yandex Academy (autumn 2023 season).
The winners will receive honor and respect, as well as a brilliant performance with a story about their model at the graduation.


## Description
In this competition you need to write a convolutional neural network for image classification.
You are provided with a dataset of chest x-ray images, including:
COVID-19 images
images of non-COVID-19 infections (viral or bacterial pneumonia)
healthy chest images
The size of the training sample (train) is 27 thousand images, the test sample (test) is 7 thousand images.
Accurate lung segmentation masks are also provided for images from the training set.

In this homework there are no restrictions on the architecture of the model, but you need to implement it yourself in pytorch/tensorflow and train it from scratch only on this dataset, without external data.

## Evaluation
**F1-SCORE**
